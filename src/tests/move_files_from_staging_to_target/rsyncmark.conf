#### FILE DESCRIPTION ####
# some of these tests will ssh/use rsync with this system. Please ssh into localhost so you can correctly
# configure the following variables

# ssh arguments, likely you wont need to change this
ssh_args=""

# rsync arguments, you won't need to change this
rsync_args="-va --delete"

# when you ssh into localhost, what is the shell prompt? 
# Typically a $ char or a # char (e.g. [bash3.2$ ] would have the shell prompt [$ ])
desintation_shell_prompt="$ "

# when you ssh into the shell and it asks you for the password, copy that line and paste it here.
# # this might look like [root@127.0.0.1's password:] (in this case you need to escape char the single quote
# # or [Password for user@.domain.edu:]
